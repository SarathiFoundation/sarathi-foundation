            <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Seeing the situation of people in Covid-19 I felt bad about them standing there waiting for someone to do something,till I realized the person I was waiting for was myself, my inner self urged me to help those people. so,I decided to help people and asked my parents my dad <b>Mohan Vasantrao Badave</b>, my mom <b>Mohini Mohan Badave</b> and my grandparents <b>Vasantrao Badave</b> and <b>Banatai Badave</b> for help. they really appreciated and motivated me to help people ,they told me that they'll backup me ﬁnancially,gradually my friends too joined me and decided to start "SARATHI FOUNDATION" with key members <br> <b> Anurag Patil, Abhi Patil, Tejas Pitroda, Girish Koli, Mihir Belekar, Pranav Patil, Kartik Kalaje, Rushikesh Patil, Rushikesh Chougule, Omkar Bhosale, Atharva Pawar, Ajay Patil, Yogesh Dhage, Pranil Jagdale, Kishor Yelawade, Prathmesh Ozarkar, Sangram Tupe.</b> <br>
              I had to decide what I was going to do, and where I was leading this idea of helping people to , but I'm pretty conﬁdent that sarathi foundation is bringing change for good and satisﬁed me,my group and friends love this too. people are getting connected to this idea and are willing to help people in need. <br>
